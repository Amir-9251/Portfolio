      "This was my very first web page when I started learning how to code. I used it to experiment with layout, images, and text — and I based it on a real-world Airbnb experience to make it feel more fun and engaging. It helped me practice HTML, CSS, and how to structure a complete page from top to bottom. Looking back, it reminds me of where I began and how far I’ve come since then.",

      "This is one of the first UI designs I built while learning front-end web development. It's a basic landing page for a fictional Space Management System project. I used placeholder text and a clean, modern layout to experiment with navigation bars, hero sections, and responsive design. Each element—like the menu, background image, and sign-in button—helped me understand how real-world websites are structured. It might look simple now, but creating this felt like a big win when I was just starting out.",
